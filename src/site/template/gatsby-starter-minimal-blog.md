A GatsbyJS starter focused on typography & minimalistic style. Write your blogposts in markdown and easily customize the look of the site. The blog has features like categories, PrismJS highlighting and previous/next notes. Because of the offline support, WebApp Manifest and extensive SEO the blog is a fully fledged PWA.
