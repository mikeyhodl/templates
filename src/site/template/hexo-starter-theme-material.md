A [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) boilerplate backed with [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms). 

This example is based on a fully responsive [material theme](https://github.com/viosey/hexo-theme-material). Added examples of Netlify's [language based redirect rules](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) to support internationalization.
