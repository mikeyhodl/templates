Bael is a free template that gives you an easy way to start a blog that uses modern technologies like static-site Jamstack architecture, CSS grid layout, responsive design, a serverless function that handles emails newsletter signup with Sendgrid, and fuzzy search â€” all wrapped up in a brutalist aesthetic.

Bael runs using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org), and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

A free Sendgrid account and API key is needed to setup the newsletter signup feature.
