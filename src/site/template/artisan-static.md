[Artisan Static](https://artisanstatic.netlify.app) is a starter template for building a static Jigsaw blog hosted on Netlify.

This comes with code highlighting, share buttons, comments, analytics, an RSS feed, a contact form, a CMS and more.

The HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this template are extremely minimal, which makes the code easy to build on top of or replace completely.
