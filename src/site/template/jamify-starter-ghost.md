Publish flaring fast blogs with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org).

This starter template is for professional publishers who are looking for a fully functional front-end with infinite-scroll, flexible routing, multi-language support and a rich plugin eco-system. It's built with performance in mind (auto image resizing, lazy loading with gatsby-image, and more) and comes with support for newsletter sign-up, easy comments integration and more. This starter features support for incremental builds thereby delivering the fastest build times ever seen.
